title: Solita Code Tasting 2012 - Raspberry
author: n1ko
excerpt: Last week we had the pleasure to host two open Coding Dojos for 30 enthustiatic programmers. The theme was Raspberry Pi and creating your own web-server that could service our demanding challenger.

### The theme ###

We had been planning to host an open Coding Dojo for some time, but were having
difficulties coming up with an interesting theme.
Some ideas circle around things like HTML5 and JavaScript (both of which had
been themes in our internal coding dojos).
But then it hit us! There was this new tasty thingie called
[Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) which was gaining interest in our
company and in general.

[Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) (or just RPi) is basically an ARM-based minicomputer.
The newest revision has 700Mhz ARM11 CPU with 512M of RAM. The device is about the size of a
small fist and uses a SDHC -card for mass storage. Pretty much the perfect device for thinkering
and testing, specially since it also has plenty GPIO pins.

### tasting.solita.fi ###

The name for the event was coined down one day before our PR-material was sent for printing, on a saturday evening.
I was sitting on a bus, trying not to throw up after a boat trip with some of my co-workers, when
[Anna](http://github.com/annaragh) nicely reminded me about the deadline for the material.
After some pretty awful brainstorming, we came up with the name, and luckily it was a pretty decent one.

After that, it was just a matter of finishing up the application form on
[tasting.solita.fi](http://https://github.com/solita/codetasting-form) and trying to get it to people's attention.

Luckily, we got tons of good applications, and were able to handpick the participants.
Some very promising guys and gals were left behind, sorry!

### Helsinki edition ###

The first of two identical events was hosted at our Helsinki office. Even though we had the whole day to prepare for our guests, we still somehow managed to blow our schedule. Last touches were made while the participants arrived. Or rather, while we were giving them a long tour around our office...

Anyways, back to the programme. We started with lightweight propaganda since we were anxious to get started with the real stuff. You can see [Ari](http://github.com/aautio) presenting our customers in the picture above in our very nice movie theater called Steve, named after Steve Jobs.

After the official brainwashing session we toured the participant's around our office and arrived at our break room Heikki (named after our founder Heikki Halme).

[Esko](http://github.org/orfjackal) started off with explaining how the [rpi-challenger](http://github.com/solita/rpi-challenger) worked and what the participants' challenge would be.

You can read more about [rpi-challenger](http://github.com/solita/rpi-challenger) and the challenge in [Esko's post](http://dev.solita.fi/2012/12/07/tasting-code-beind-the-event.html).

### Coding in Helsinki ###

After the challenge was given and people started working, I was really anxious to see how the challenge would work out. Would it be enough of a challenge for a evening or perheps too difficult for the students? We used Git as our revision control system and participants had a little bit of trouble with Git at first, but after they got their repositories up & running everything started to run really smooth.

The challenge allowed participants to choose their technology. Since the participants only had a short amout of time to build a web server, a logical choice was a language like [Python](http://www.python.org/), and all teams except one chose Python. And the team that didn't pick Python went with [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) which is extremely suitable for a task like this too. Even though majority built with [Python](http://www.python.org/) we saw plenty of different kind of approaches for tackling the tasks. Different libraries were used and it was fun to see how differently people were solving the tasks.

Since the [rpi-challenger](http://github.com/solita/rpi-challenger) was giving out points for each minute based on their success we were able to show live stats during the event. Just like in any good sport event, the competition was even.

The winning team was able to gather 488 points, an awesome score! They were also the only team doing unit tests for their implementation. Coincidence? Probably not.

Here is [Anna](http://github.com/annara) giving out prizes for the winning pair. Good job guys!

After giving out the prizes and wrapping up our main program of the evening we had very enjoyable chats with some of the participants. Hopefully we will see your applications in our recruitment inbox too ;)

### Tampere edition ###

Tampere version of this event was hosted the very next evening (5th of December). In our Helsinki event we hosted 14 people but since the Tampere event was a bit more popular we decided to pick 16 people. There were just so many good applicants!

[![tre_koodestelu](/img/codetasting/small/tre_koodestelu.jpg)](/img/codetasting/tre_koodestelu.jpg)

The programme was pretty much the same as in Helsinki; light propaganda, tour around the offices, ferocious programming, beer, pizza, beer and getting to know each other.

[![tre_koodestelu2](/img/codetasting/small/tre_koodestelu2.jpg)](/img/codetasting/tre_koodestelu2.jpg)

The big difference between Tampere and Helsinki events was that since TUT uses C++ in their courses rather than the Python Aalto university uses we saw a bigger diversity between the technologies chosen and applied. Some teams went with NodeJS, others with Python and one team even went with Java.

Just like night before we started up slow with some Git troubles, but after everybody got their repositories going and managed to get their webserver running, things started to pick up. The teams were even more even in Tampere than in Helsinki, and the top two teams were fighting for the prize till the last half a hour.

### See you next year? ###

We had great fun hosting these events and hopefully the participants enjoyed them too. We are looking forward to hosting some more, so stay tuned!

P.S. And for those of you, that didn't get picked this time, remember to watch this space and apply again! We had to drop some very good people because of the large number of applications. Also, we're sorry about the limited space that we gave you to tell us about youself. It clearly wasn't enough for some of you. Sorry about that again :(
