title: Solita Code Tasting 2012 - Raspberry
author: n1ko
excerpt: Last week we had the pleasure to host two open Coding Dojos for 30 enthustiatic programmers. The theme was Raspberry Pi and creating your own web-server that could service our demanding challenger.

### The theme ###

We had been planning to host a open Coding Dojo for some time but hadn't really come up with an interesting theme. 
Some ideas previously were circling around things like HTML5 or JavaScript (which both had been themes of our internal happenings). 
But then it hit us! There was this newish tasty thingie called [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) which had interested many people in our company.

[Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) or just RPi is basicly a ARM-based minicomputer.
The newest revision has 700Mhz ARM11 CPU with 512M of RAM. The device is about the size of a 
small fist and uses a SDHC -card for mass storage. Pretty much the perfect device for thinkering
and testing, specially since it also has plenty GPIO pins.

### tasting.solita.fi ###

The name for the event was coined down one day before our PR-material went for the printer, on a saturday evening.
I myself was sitting on a bus trying not to throw up (after being on a boat trip with some co-workes) when
[Anna](http://github.com/annara) reminded me nicely about the deadline for the material.
After some pretty bad brainstorming we came up with the name, and luckily it was pretty decent.

After that it was just matter of finishing up the application form on 
[tasting.solita.fi](http://https://github.com/solita/codetasting-form) and trying to get it people's attention. 

Luckily we got tons of good applications, and were able to handpick the participants. 
Some good guys and gals were left behind, sorry!

### Helsinki edition ###

The first of two identical events was hosted at our Helsinki office. Even though we had the whole day to prepare for our guests we still somehow managed blow our schedule. Last touches were made while the participants arrived and maybe even some weird made when we were giving them a tour around our office...

Anyways, back to the programme. We started with lightweight propaganda since we were anxious to get started with the real stuff. You can see [Ari](http://github.com/aautio) presenting our customers in the picture above in our very nice movie theater called Steve. And yes, it's after Steve Jobs.

After the official brainwashing session we toured the participant's around our office and arrived at our break room Heikki (after our founder Heikki Halme).

[Esko](http://github.org/orfjackal) started of with explaining how the [rpi-challenger](http://github.com/solita/rpi-challenger) worked and what the participants challenge was. 

You can read more about [rpi-challenger](http://github.com/solita/rpi-challenger) and the challenge in [Esko's post](http://dev.solita.fi/2012/12/07/tasting-code-beind-the-event.html).

### Coding in Helsinki ###

After the challenge was given and people started working I was really anxious to see how the challenge would work out. Would it be enough of a challenge for a evening or perheps too difficult for the students. We used Git as our revision control system and participants had little bit of a trouble with that first, but after they got their repositories up and running everything started to run really smooth.

The challenge allowed participants to choose their technology. Since you had built a web server fast a logical choice was language like [Python](http://www.python.org/), and all teams except chose that one. And the team that didn't went with [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) which is extremely suitable for a task like this too. Even though majority of the teams went with [Python](http://www.python.org/) we saw plenty of different kind of approaches to task. Different libraries were used and it was fun to see how differently people were solving the tasks.

Since the [rpi-challenger](http://github.com/solita/rpi-challenger) was giving out points for each time based on their success we were able to show live stats the whole event. Just like any good sport event there even competation to the end.

The winning team was able to gather 488 points, an awesome score! They were also the only team doing unit tests for their implementation. Coincidence? Probably not.

Here is [Anna](http://github.com/annara) giving out prizes for the winning pair. Good job guys!

After giving out the prizes and wrapping up our main program of the evening we had very enjoyable chats with some of the participants. Hopefully we will see your applications in our recrumeint inbox too ;)

### Tampere edition ###

Tampere version of this event was hosted the next evening (5th of December). In our Helsinki event we hosted 14 people but since the Tampere event was a bit more popular we decided to pick 16 people their since we couldn't drop so many good applicants.

The programme was pretty much the same as in Helsinki; mild propaganda, some touring around the offices, feroucious programming, beer, pizza, beer and getting to know each other.

The big difference between Tampere and Helsinki events was that since TUT uses C++ in their courses rather than the Python Aalto university uses we saw a bigger diversity between the technologies chosen and applied. Some teams went with NodeJS, others with Python and one team even went with Java.

Just like night before we started up slow with some Git troubles, but after everybody got their repositories going and managed tot get their webserver running things started to speed up. The teams were even more even in Tampere than in Helsinki, and the top two teams were fighting for the prize till the last half a hour. 

### See you next year? ###

We had great fun hosting these events and hopefully the participants enjoyed them too. We are looking forward to hosting some more, so stay tuned!

And those of you that didn't get picked this time, remember to try again! We had to drop some very good people because of the applicant amounts and the limited space that we gave you to tell us about youself wasn't clearly enough for some of you. Sorry again :(
