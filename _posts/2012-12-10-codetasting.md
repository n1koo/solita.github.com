author: n1ko
excerpt: Last week we had the pleasure to host two open Coding Dojos for 30 enthustiatic programmers. The theme was Raspberry Pi and creating your own web-server that could service our demanding challenger.

### The theme ###

We had been planning to host a open Coding Dojo for some time but hadn't really come up with an interesting theme. 
Some ideas previously were circling around things like HTML5 or JavaScript (which both had been themes of our internal happenings). 
But then it hit us! There was this newish tasty thingie called [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) which had interested many people in our company.

[Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) or just RPi is basicly a ARM-based minicomputer.
The newest revision has 700Mhz ARM11 CPU with 512M of RAM. The device is about the size of a 
small fist and uses a SDHC -card for mass storage. Pretty much the perfect device for thinkering
and testing, specially since it also has plenty GPIO pins.

The name for the event was coined down one day before our PR-material went for the printer, on a saturday evening.
I myself was sitting on a bus trying not to throw up (after being on a boat trip with some co-workes) when
[Anna](http://github.com/annara) reminded me nicely about the deadline for the material.
After some pretty bad brainstorming we came up with the name, and luckily it was pretty decent.

After that it was just matter of finishing up the application form on 
[tasting.solita.fi](http://https://github.com/solita/codetasting-form) and trying to get it people's attention. 

Luckily we got tons of good applications, and were able to handpick the participants. 
Some good guys and gals were left behind, sorry!
